        This project will be completed in a team; audio will be obtained from third-party websites that make their assets available under the Creative Commons license for commercial purposes.
        
        Main task will be design, programming and creating graphics.
    
    * **What equipment is needed for this project?**   

        A computer (with keyboard, mouse, and speakers) and internet access will be necessary to complete this project.
    
    * **What are the tasks that need to be accomplished to create this game?**    

        The three phases this project will go through will be: 
        * Concept phase (1-3 months)
        * Preproduction phase (2-3 months)
        * Production phase
            * alpha
            * beta
            * release

        This project will use a simple Kanban board hosted on the project's GitHub page.
        The main sequence of steps to complete this project is as follows:    
        * Setting up a project scaffold
        * **Programming game mechanics and UI**
        * **Creating and obtaining graphical assets**
        * Obtaining audio assets
        * Controller support
        * **Polishing**
        * Publishing

    * **What points in the development process are suitable for playtesting?**    

        External testers:
        The main points for playtesting are when the basic game mechanics of the level screen are implemented, and when it is visualised. The questions that will be asked are:         
        * Is the gameplay and UI understandable?
        * Is the gameplay interesting?
        * How do the controls feel?
        * How is the pace of the game?
        * Are there any improvement suggestions?        
    
    * **What are the plans for publication and Monetization?**

    Possibly a game store publication (Steam), single sale.

    * **What are the plans for Marketing/PR?**

    We will tweet about the game progression, possibly when we enter preproduction. Maybe devlogs? -On youtube, itch/github.

## Other
### Some design questions to consider:
* Do you have to prepare before taking on the challenge?
* Can you prepare in different ways and still succeed?
* Does the environment in which the challenge take place affect the challenge?
* Are there solid rules defined for the challenge you udnertake?
* Can the core mechanic support multiple types of challenges?
* Can the player bring multiple abilities to bear on the challenge?
* At high levels of difficulty, does the player *have* to bring multiple abilities to bear on the challenge?
* Is there skill involved in using an ability? (If not, is this a fundamental "move" in the games, like moving one checker piece?)
* Are there multiple success states to overcoming the challenge? )In other words, success should not have a single guaranteed result.)
