* Breadth First Development: Develop cross-sections rather than focusing on one aspect.
* Present your work frequently/daily
* Make your inspiration and artwork visible

### Mechanical

### Nuclear
Nuclear pokemons is a race of creatures affected by nuclear fallout and devestation following the post-apocalyptic event. Their `unyielding` nature is complemented by `big` `rounded shapes`, `curved lines` and `green colour`. Their speed is `sluggish` And their texture is `oozing`. They're quite the contrast to the long and elegant aliens.
