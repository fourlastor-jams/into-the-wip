Good studio practice: 
* Breadth First Development: Develop cross-sections rather than focusing on one aspect.
* Present your work frequently/daily
* Make your inspiration and artwork visible

## High Concept
Want each character designed to answer questions about every item on the `checklist of key design concepts`:
* Emotion?
* Colour?
* Shape?
* Texture?
* Line?
* Speed?
* Size?
* Opposing concept?

## Pokemons
Each pokemon is assigned _one or two_ of the five types.
### Nuclear
Nuclear pokemons is a race of creatures affected by nuclear fallout and devestation following the post-apocalyptic event. Their `unyielding` nature is complemented by `big` `rounded shapes`, `curved lines` and `green colour`. Their speed is `sluggish` And their texture is `oozing`. They're quite the contrast to the long and elegant aliens.
